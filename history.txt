# infrequent metadynamics simulation starting from run.sh script. Starting structures 'geo_end.gen', velocities 'velocities.npy' and charges 'eq2_charges.bin' in this folder taken from previous equilibration run in trans state.
# run.sh automatically generates a new directory where a new equilibration is run with a random amount of equilibration steps and a small random perturbation of the starting velocities.
# number of timesteps and metadynamics parameters have to be defined in the runx folder.

# execute 30 runs on 6 CPUs
parallel -j 6 bash run.sh -- {1..30}

# extract the transition times (scaled and unscaled) from the COLVAR files
python extract_times.py

# calculate the rate (Salvalaglio 2014 paper)
python calculate_rate.py
